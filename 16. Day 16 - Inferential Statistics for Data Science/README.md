### Topic: Inferential Statistics

**Central Limit Theorem (CLT):**
- The Fundamental Idea: CLT is the backbone of inferential stats. It tells us that, regardless of a population's distribution, if we take large enough samples, the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.
- Why It Matters: This theorem enables us to apply many statistical methods, like hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

**Deriving P-values:** 
- A p-value is a statistical measure that helps us determine the strength of evidence against a null hypothesis in a hypothesis test.

**Significance Level:** 
- The significance level (often denoted as alpha) is a predefined threshold that helps us decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
- Choosing the significance level depends on the desired balance between Type I and Type II errors.

**Z-Test:**
- What It Does: Z-test helps us determine if a sample mean is significantly different from a known population mean, assuming we know the population standard deviation.
- Note: We need to know the population standard deviation.

**T-Test:**
- When to use: T-test is our go-to when comparing means of two groups, especially with small samples (usually less than 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown.
- Note: There are different types of T-tests, catering to various scenarios like independent samples, paired samples, and one-sample comparisons.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaways:**
- The Central Limit Theorem lays the groundwork for robust statistical inferences.
- Z-test is the choice when you know the population standard deviation and have a sizeable sample.
- T-test steps in for versatile hypothesis testing, especially with smaller samples or when population data isn't entirely clear.
- Knowing when to apply each test is pivotal for sound statistical conclusions in data science. Checkout the notes for detailed explanations and sample questions.
