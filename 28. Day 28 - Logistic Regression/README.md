## **DAY 28 (16 Oct 2023):**
### Topic: Understanding the Logistic Regression

ðŸ“Œ**Key Takeaways:**
1. Logistic Regression operates with a sigmoid curve, making it suitable for binary classification tasks.
2. The key objective is to find the optimal decision boundary that effectively separates the data points into different classes.
3. It's crucial to understand the logit function, which transforms the probability values into a linear equation.
4. Logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable.
5. Explored the cost function in Logistic Regression, crucial for model optimization.
6. The decision boundary in Logistic Regression can be linear or nonlinear, depending on the complexity of the data.
