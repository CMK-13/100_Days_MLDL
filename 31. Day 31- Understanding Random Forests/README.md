## **DAY 31 (19 Oct 2023):**
### Topic: Understanding Random Forests

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Decision Trees Aggregation:** Random Forest combines the outputs of multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance and control overfitting.

2. **Bagging and Variance Reduction:** Through the Bagging technique, Random Forest can reduce variance by introducing diversity among individual trees.

3. **Feature Subspace Sampling:** Random Forest employs feature subspace sampling during the training process, where different subsets of features are selected for different trees, enhancing the robustness of the model.

4. **Handling Overfitting:** Random Forest effectively handles overfitting due to the aggregation of multiple decision trees. The process of averaging and voting reduces the risk of a single tree overfitting to noise in the data.

5. **Out-of-Bag Error:** The Out-of-Bag (OOB) error estimation is an essential feature of Random Forest that allows for the evaluation of the model's performance without the need for cross-validation.
