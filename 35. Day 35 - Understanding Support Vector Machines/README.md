## **DAY 35 (23 Oct 2023):**
### Topic: Understanding Support Vector Machines

1. Understanding Concept of SVC
2. What are Support Vectors
3. What is Margin
4. Hard Margin and Soft Margin
5. Kernelized SVC
6. Types of Kernels
7. Understanding SVR

üîç Key Takeaways:
1. Support Vector Machines (SVM) can be used for classification and regression tasks. Makes them effective for both linear and nonlinear data.

2. SVMs find the best possible boundary or hyperplane to segregate different classes.

3. The kernel trick can help SVMs handle non-linear data by transforming it into a higher dimension. SVMs are particularly effective for handling high-dimensional data.

4. While hard margin SVM ensures a more rigid decision boundary, it might be sensitive to outliers and noise, potentially leading to poor generalization. Soft margin SVM, on the other hand, offers more flexibility and robustness.

5. SVR aims to find a function that best fits the data points while maintaining a permissible margin of error. It seeks to minimize the error while maximizing the margin. Check out the notes for more.
