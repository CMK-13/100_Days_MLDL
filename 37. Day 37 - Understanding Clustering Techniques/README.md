## **DAY 37 (25 Oct 2023):**
### Topic: Understanding Clustering Techniques

âš¡ In the past few days, I have grasped the intricate details of important Supervised learning algorithms, and from today I embarked on understanding the unsupervised algorithms, starting with the intricate world of clustering techniques.

**Topics Discussed in Notes:**
1. How clustering is different from classification
2. Applications of Clustering
3. What are density based methods
4. What are Hierarchial based methods
5. What are partitioning methods
6. What are Grid Based methods
7. Main Requirements for Clustering Algorithms

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Clustering differs from classification in that it doesn't involve predefined classes or labels. It groups data points based on similarities, aiming to discover inherent structures within the data.

2. Clustering finds application in various fields, including customer segmentation in marketing, anomaly detection in cybersecurity, image segmentation in computer vision, and document clustering in natural language processing

3. Density-based methods identify clusters as regions with higher density than the remainder of the data space. They're effective at handling clusters of arbitrary shapes and are robust against noise.

4. Hierarchical-based methods create a cluster hierarchy or tree, known as a dendrogram, representing the relationships between the clusters. They can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) in nature.

5. Partitioning methods aim to partition the data into non-overlapping clusters. The most popular example is the k-means algorithm, which divides the data points into k clusters, with each point belonging to the cluster with the nearest mean.
