## **DAY 42 (30 Oct 2023):**
### Topic: Understanding Curse of Dimensionality

**Topics Discussed in Notes:**
1. Computational Complexity
2. Data Visualization Challenges

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Increased Sparsity: High-dimensional spaces often suffer from sparsity, where the data points are widely scattered. Consequently, the available data points may not adequately represent the underlying data distribution, making it challenging to generalize accurately.

2. Computational Complexity: With an increase in the number of dimensions, the computational complexity of algorithms also rises significantly. Many algorithms become computationally expensive and time-consuming, hampering the overall efficiency of data analysis.

3. Overfitting: The curse of dimensionality can lead to overfitting in machine learning models, causing them to capture noise or irrelevant patterns.

4. Data Visualization Challenges: Visualizing and comprehending data in high-dimensional spaces become increasingly complex.

5. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, various techniques and strategies have been developed, such as dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, LDA), feature selection, and feature extraction.
