1. At its core, deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks on vast datasets to make sense of complex patterns. These neural networks, inspired by the human brain, consist of layers of interconnected nodes, each contributing to the understanding of data in progressively more abstract ways. It draws inspiration from the concept of artificial neural networks (ANNs), which can be traced back to the 1940s and 1950s. 

2. In the 1970s, following its conceptualization, deep learning faced setbacks during the "AI winter," marked by limited progress due to computational constraints and insufficient data. However, the early 2000s witnessed a resurgence.

3. The revival of deep learning owes much to the explosion of big data and advancements in computational power. In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton and his team published a groundbreaking paper on training deep neural networks, reigniting interest in the field.

4. Building Blocks of Deep Learning:
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): Mimicking the neural connections in our brains, ANNs are the foundation of deep learning. Layers of interconnected nodes process information, and the network learns through iterative training.

Activation Functions: These determine the output of each node or "neuron" in a neural network, introducing non-linearity to the model and enabling it to learn complex patterns.

Backpropagation: A critical algorithm for training neural networks, backpropagation adjusts the model's parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs.

5. Applications Across Industries:
The applications of deep learning are vast and impactful:
Computer Vision: Recognizing patterns in images and videos.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understanding and generating human language.
Speech Recognition: Transcribing spoken words into text.
Recommendation Systems: Personalizing suggestions based on user behavior.

In the coming days, this deep learning journey will delve into advanced architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence data, and the fascinating world of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
